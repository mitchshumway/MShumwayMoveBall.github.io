# Bonus Move Ball Exercise

This project required me to combine knowledge of CSS and JavaScript to create and animate balls on the screen. My ultimate goal with this project is to have the small balls bounce around inside of the bigger ball as it moves around the screen. I plan to revisit this project to make this happen.
